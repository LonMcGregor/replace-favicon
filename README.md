# Replace-Favicons

This is a browser extension to replace a site's favicon if it is currently missing one.

It is based on an original extension found on th echrome store, but will have the following improvements:

* No jquery to inject onto every single page
* Use an open source identicon generator, not gravatar
* Don't make web request to an identicon generator, so it should load on local pages too
